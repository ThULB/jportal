# This is a sample RC configuration file used by SqlTool, DatabaseManager,
# and any other program that uses the org.hsqldb.util.RCData class.

# You can run SqlTool right now by copying this file to your home directory
# and running
#    java -jar /path/to/hsqldb.jar mem
# This will access the first urlid definition below in order to use a 
# personal Memory-Only database.

# If you have the least concerns about security, then secure access to
# your RC file.
# See the documentation for SqlTool for various ways to use this file.

# This is for a hsqldb Server running with default settings on your local
# computer (and for which you have not changed the password for "sa").
