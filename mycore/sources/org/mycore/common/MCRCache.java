/**
 * Instances of this class can be used as object cache. Each MCRCache has a
 * certain capacity, the maximum number of objects the cache will hold. When the
 * cache is full and another object is put into the cache, the cache will
 * discard the least recently used object to get place for the new object. The
 * cache will always hold the most recently used objects by updating its
 * internal structure whenever an object is get from the cache or put into the
 * cache. The cache also provides methods for getting the current cache hit rate
 * and fill rate. Like in a hashtable, an MCRCache uses a unique key for each
 * object.
