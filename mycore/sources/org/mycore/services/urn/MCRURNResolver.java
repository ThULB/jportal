/**
 * This servlet resolves a given URN (urn:nbn:de) from a HTTP request and
 * redirects the client to the document that is registered for this URN. The URN
 * can be either given as the query string or as the request path. If the URN is
 * assigned to a local document, the request is redirected to the frontpage that
 * displays the document's metadata, as specified by the configuration property
 * MCR.URN.Resolver.DocumentURL. If the URN is not local, the request is
 * redirected to another URN resolver, as specified by the configuration
 * property MCR.URN.Resolver.MasterURL.
