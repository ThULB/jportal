Patch #001, 2007-07-27
========================================================================
Affected component:
module-imaging -> image cache (and all components that use this cache, 
e.g  module-iview)

Problem to be solved: 
Image-Cache of "module imaging" is inconsistent. This
patch will solve this problem and repairs the image-cache.

When to use:
MyCoRe-Repositories, that run with MyCoRe-Code older than 2007-07-28, 
do have a bug in the image-cache, used by module-imaging

What to do:
