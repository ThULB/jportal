- How to use translate.java?

	You need JDOM to compile translate.java
	After a successful compilation you can use it with the following parameters
		translate sourceDir outDir -lang de,en,ru
		
		sourceDir is the directory of the stylesheets (XSL)
		outDir is the directory where the results is stored
		-lang de,en,ru is the information for the language you use in your docportal
		
	For a working docportal after transformed all the stylesheets you can take the stylesheets directory from WEB-INF
	take out all the *Creaate-Mask*.xsl and the editor.xsl. And of course you have to integrate the i18n java class from
	Mycore 1.3.
