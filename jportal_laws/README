This readme describes how to add the jportal_laws module to jportal2 and create
a sample volume.

First of all you have to add the module to the docportal pom.xml.
<dependency>
  <groupId>fsu.thulb</groupId>
  <artifactId>jportal_laws</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>compile</scope>      
</dependency>

Be aware that the version is probably wrong!

Before you can create a new journal its important to add a new category 'register'
to the 'ID types [jportal_class_00000010]' classification. Go to Editors ->
Classification Editor -> ID types -> Insert new category. Add the category 'register'
and save the classification.

The laws module contains a new template called template_thLegislativeExecutiv. This
template provides a view to show the register entrys of a volume. 

Create a new journal and select the template_thLegislativeExecutiv as new template.
Add a volume to this journal. In the editor you have to set the ID entry to 'register'
and the value to '1821_Register.xml'. This is an example, all register xml files are
stored under src/main/resources/web/register. You can easily select another one.

Now the xml file is linked with the volume. You can see the entries by clicking on 
'show table of contents'.

Linking the nr. of each law with the imageviewer is very easy. Simply upload a
derivate with the files inside. For example you can download the Herzogtum Altenburg
1821 from the productive system
(http://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/servlets/MCRZipServlet?id=jportal_derivate_00199933) and
upload on your test system. The links should appear automatic.

This works because a METS file for the derivate is created by the system (LawsMETSGenerator).
