This readme describes how to add the jportal_laws module to jportal2 and create
a sample volume.

First of all you have to add the module to the docportal pom.xml.
<dependency>
  <groupId>fsu.thulb</groupId>
  <artifactId>jportal_laws</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>compile</scope>      
</dependency>

Be aware that the version is probably wrong!

The laws module contains a new template called template_thLegislativeExecutiv. This
template provides a view to show the register entrys of a volume. 

Create a new journal and select template_thLegislativeExecutiv as new template.
Add a volume to this journal. Now you can upload your Register_*.xml as a new
derivate to the volume. If successfull you can see the entries by clicking on 
'show table of contents'.

Linking the nr. of each law with the imageviewer is very easy. Simply upload a
derivate with the files inside. For example you can download the Herzogtum Altenburg
1821 from the productive system
(http://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/servlets/MCRZipServlet?id=jportal_derivate_00199933) and
upload on your test system. The links should appear automatic.

Its important that the register and the images are in two seperate derivates. You can now
hide the register by clicking at "Derivat verstecken".
