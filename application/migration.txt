Migration description
=====================

Migration from SNAPSHOT_20061130 to SNAPSHOT_20070116
-----------------------------------------------------

The current snapshot from 2007-01-16 has some changes in the organisation
of the data directories. All code and configuration data generated by
'ant' commands are now stored in the build directory.
All appliction data directories like filestore or from HSQLDB are now in the
directory data by default. Only the save directory for system
backups is on the same old place in the application root.

The data directories will be placed in the directories which you have 
defined in config/mycore.properties.private.

Because the location of the data directories depends on your property
definitions we cannot provide you with a miration script.
You can migrate in two ways:
- Do not change the properties of directory locations and let all data
in their place (not recommended).
- Copy mycore.properties.private.template over your old properties and alter
any properties you need (mainly "MCR.basedir"). Run "ant create.directories" and
move all old data directories like "lucene-*" and "hsqldb-data" et al. to the
"data" directory (recommended).

Run in docportal to migrate:
- ant create.directories
- ant jar
- ant create.schema
- ant create.scripts
- ant webapps

After "ant create.scripts" all scripts are in build/bin. Remove all obsolate
files (e.g bin/mycore.*) and directories in the root of the application.
